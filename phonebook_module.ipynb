    "I first start by creating the database and connect to sqlite3. I then use the cursor funtion to execute SQL commands and assign it to 'connection'. I then check to see if the table exists so I use the cursor.execute funtion to see if the Entries table already exists. I then create a if function if the table doesnt exist to create the table. I start by using the cursor.execute funtion to create the Entries table. I then need to define the columns of the table so I use a type of INTEGER and use it as the primary key for the table. The PRIMARY KEY will make sure each row has a unique value for its column. I then store name and phone number and make sure it doesnt contain null values. \n",
    "\n",
    "I then need make the add_entries funtion to add a name and number. I use the cursor.execute function insert name and phone number into the table. I then create a print statement to show the original phone numbers added to the Entries.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I then create the lookup_name funtion to look up name. I use SQL SELECT statement to get the phone number and FROM to tell program to look for it in the Entries table. \n",
    "\n",
    "I create the update_entry funtion to update a phone number from name. I use SQL SET statement to assign new_phone_number from phone_number. And use SQL WHERE statement to tell program to assign new_phone_number correlated with the name. I also use name=? as a placeholder. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, I create the delete_entry funtion to delete an entry from the table. I use the SQL DELETE statement to delete an entire entry from the table. \n"
