    "In this exercise I am asked to assign the elements in numbers1 to numbers2. I first start by improting random to randomize 100 numbers to be assigned as elements in numbers1. I then need to create a list that will hold the elements and repeat 100 times. I then create a for loop to generate 100 numbers to be used as the elements in numbers1 list. I then use the random.randint funtion to randomly generate 100 numbers. I then make numbers2 have 0 elements. I then add numbers1 and numbers2 together so the elements inside numbers1 will now be in numbers2. Lastly, I create 2 print statements to let the user know the elements have been copied and then the next print statement displays the elements in the list. "

    "In this exercise I am asked to determine if ruby is in a name list. I first start by getting the names for the list and assign it to 'names'. I then need to get user input to search for a name. I create an input statement and assign it to name_search. I then need to determine if the name entered by the user is in the list. I create an if statement and use the in operator. Inside the if statement I put 2 print statements. If the in variable comes back true then it will output the first print statement telling the user the name is in the list. If it comes back false the program will tell the user the name is not in the list. "

    "In this exercise I am asked to get the sales for each day from the user and then create a loop to add the total sales. I first create a hold amount to determine how many times the loop itterates. I then create the main function and then create a list to hold sales. I then create a print statement to tell the user to enter the sales for each day. I then create a for loop and use the len funtion to return the length of the sequence. I then need to add the total sales together. I asked chatgpt on how to add input from lists together. It showed me to use the sum() funtion to add them all together. I then needed to show the total sales from the 7 days. I create a print statement to show total sales. I also asked chatgpt how to format a floating point number inside a print statement so it only shows 2 decimal places. It told me to use the f-string inside brackets. "
