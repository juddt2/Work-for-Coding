    "In this exercise I am asked to assign the elements in numbers1 to numbers2. I first start by improting random to randomize 100 numbers to be assigned as elements in numbers1. I then need to create a list that will hold the elements and repeat 100 times. I then create a for loop to generate 100 numbers to be used as the elements in numbers1 list. I then use the random.randint funtion to randomly generate 100 numbers. I then make numbers2 have 0 elements. I then add numbers1 and numbers2 together so the elements inside numbers1 will now be in numbers2. Lastly, I create 2 print statements to let the user know the elements have been copied and then the next print statement displays the elements in the list. "

    "In this exercise I am asked to get the sales for each day from the user and then create a loop to add the total sales. I first create a hold amount to determine how many times the loop itterates. I then create the main function and then create a list to hold sales. I then create a print statement to tell the user to enter the sales for each day. I then create a for loop and use the len funtion to return the length of the sequence. I then need to add the total sales together. I asked chatgpt on how to add input from lists together. It showed me to use the sum() funtion to add them all together. I then needed to show the total sales from the 7 days. I create a print statement to show total sales. I also asked chatgpt how to format a floating point number inside a print statement so it only shows 2 decimal places. It told me to use the f-string inside brackets. "
