    "This exercise asked me to have a user enter a number then calcualate it by 10 and assign it to the product variable. I first started to assign product to 1 so the program initializes it. I then insert the while loop and have the user enter a number. I then assign product to multiply user by 10. The program processes that and as output I made a print statement. If the number was over 100 I wrote another print statement to tell the user that the number is over the max. "

    " This exercise asks to write a loop that asks for a number and keeps track of the running total. I first started with assigning 2 variables. I then added the for loop to run 10 times to track passing yards for 10 games. I first labled every game so I added the game variable to 1. I then made a print statement to output each game. I then had the user enter the passing yards for every game. I then added the total variable to the number variable entered by the user. I then had to output what the user entered.
