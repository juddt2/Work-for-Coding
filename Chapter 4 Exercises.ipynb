    "This exercise asked me to have a user enter a number then calcualate it by 10 and assign it to the product variable. I first started to assign product to 1 so the program initializes it. I then insert the while loop and have the user enter a number. I then assign product to multiply user by 10. The program processes that and as output I made a print statement. If the number was over 100 I wrote another print statement to tell the user that the number is over the max. "
